\usage{
item_assignment(
  distances,
  n_groups,
  solver,
  is_in_minority_class,
  n_leaders_minority
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_groups}{How many groups are to be created.}

\item{solver}{A string identifing the solver to be used ("Rglpk",
"gurobi", or "cplex")}

\item{items}{A data.frame of item features. Rows must correspond to
items and columns to features.}

\item{standardize}{Boolean - should the feature values be
standardized before groups are created? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{heuristic}{Set the level of "heuristicism" by setting a numeric
value of 0 to 3. Set to 0 to obtain the exact solution for the item
assignment instance. Levels 1 to 3 will in a first step identify
very similar items and then ensure that these will be assigned to
different groups. Level 1 does this preclustering using exact
cluster editing; Level 2 does this preclustering using a heuristic
based on k-means clustering. On Level 3, preclustering is also done
using the heuristic based on k-means clustering, and the final
assignment is no longer done using exact ILP item assignment, but
instead using a simple random assignment.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing one column of item ids (here, the id
    corresponds to the order of the items) and one column contains the
    group assignments of the items. The original items are also
    returned as columns of the data.frame.
