\title{Solve the ILP formulation of the item assignment problem}
\usage{
solve_ilp(ilp, solver, objective = "min")
}
\arguments{
\item{ilp}{An object representing the ILP formulation of the
instance, returned by `item_assign_ilp`}

\item{solver}{A string identifing the solver to be used ("Rglpk",
"gurobi", or "cplex")}

\item{objective}{A string identifying whether the objective function
of the ILP should be maximized ("max") or minimized
("min"). Maximizing creates similar groups (i.e., solves item
assignment), minimizing creates distinct clusters (i.e., solves
cluster editing).}
}
\value{
A `list` having two entries: `x` is the vector of optimal
  coefficients for all decision variables. `obj` is the optimal
  objective value.
}
\description{
Usually it will be advised to call the higher level function
`item_assignment` By setting the `objective` parameter to "min", this
function solves weighted cluster editing instead of item assignment.
