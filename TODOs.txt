- Add new argument to interface function:
  * (Optional) Scalar, logical: homogeneity vs. heterogeneity of coding within-groups (default: heterogeneity; otherwise, uses anticlust::balanced_clustering() and adjusts pairwise distances among differently coded items)

- matchMFC currently uses internal anticlust function anticlust:::edit_distances, do differently
- anticlust::optimal_anticlustering throws an error when time limit is exceeded.... TODO do differently
- test for reconciliation of different constraints (e.g. warning / error when something goes wrong)
