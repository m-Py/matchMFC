- Add new argument to interface function:
  * (Optional) Scalar, logical: homogeneity vs. heterogeneity of coding within-groups (default: heterogeneity; otherwise, uses anticlust::balanced_clustering() and adjusts pairwise distances among differently coded items)

- anticlust::optimal_anticlustering throws an error when time limit is exceeded.... TODO do differently
- test for reconciliation of different constraints (e.g. warning / error when something goes wrong)

- all(table(anticlust::categorical_sampling(scales, p), scales) < 2) -> should test if scale constraints can be met at all (Without considering the constraints on item polarity)

- testing if both types of constraints (scale / polarity) can be fulfilled simultaneously may be done most efficiently (?) with the ILP model by Schulz (2022) when treating both types information as categorical variables
