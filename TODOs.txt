- Add interface function
  * internally handles recoding the distance matrix
- Arguments:
  * Matrix: (Dis)similarity matrix or feature matrix
  * Scalar: number of groups
  * Vector: Scale of each items
  * (Optional) Vector, logical: Is each item positively coded (if not passed, uses anticlust::balanced_clustering())
  * Scalar, logical: Minimization or maximization (i.e., similarity vs. dissimilarity matrix)? (Minimization = default for feature matrix);
  * (Optional) Scalar, number of groups with negatively scaled items.
  * (Optional) Scalar, logical: homogeneity vs. heterogeneity of coding within-groups (default: heterogeneity; otherwise, uses anticlust::balanced_clustering() and adjusts pairwise distances among differently coded items)

- anticlust::optimal_anticlustering throws an error when time limit is exceeded.... TODO do differently
- better test for reconciliation of different constraints
